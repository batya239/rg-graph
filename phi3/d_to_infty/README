= T U R B U L E N C E : $d \to \infty$ =

Program:

For every $\phi^3$ static diagram 'd':

1. Find all pairs (spine, half-spine)           <-- done

2. In BFS-style:
    - for every vertex 'v' of 'd':
        - for every edge incident with 'v':
            - put 'dot' and 'prime' according to
              some 'filters' (e.g. 'prime'-'prime' edges are prohibited)

3. [optional] Draw all results as multigraps    <-- partly done
