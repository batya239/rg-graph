*** How it works ***

This README contains manual for generating and calculating answers
to the "Theory without divergences" in turbulence in 'd_to_infty' case.

1) Generating all the diagrams in N loops, such that satisfy the requirement of existence of 'spine' and 'half-spine':

    $ python spine.py

or if you want run in parallel:

    $ ipython parallel_spine.py

NB: in the parallel case ipcluster MUST be already started with the profile_default.

Results:
* directory ./diags_N_loops/ created
* file ./diags_N_loops/count created
* files ./diags_N_loops/diag created – contain lists of dynamic diags that correspond to this static diag

2) Filtering zero diagrams: (it works fast enough, no need to parallelize).

    $ python filter_zero.py

Result:
* directory ./diags_N_loops/nonzero created – contains lists of all nonzero dynamic diagrams

3) Writing down integrands:
