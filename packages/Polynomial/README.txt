PolynomialTools module description

= WTF? =

Library allows to produce symbolic calculations over integrands for SD

= Description =

simple example you can find in [http://code.google.com/p/rg-graph/source/browse/packages/Polynomial/examples/eye.py]

allowed actions on integrands:
 * differentiate by one of variables
 * stretch some set of variables by another one
 * simplifying integrands by per-polynomial factorization
 * epsilon expansion of integrands
 * translate result to cpp or python code
