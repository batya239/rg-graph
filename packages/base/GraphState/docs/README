GraphState and Graphine are graph manipulation libraries. The key feature of these libraries is usage of generalization
of graph representation offered by B. G. Nickel et al. In this approach graph is represented in some unique 'canonical' form
that depends only on its combinatorial type. The uniqueness of graph representation gives an efficient way for isomorphism finding,
searching for subgraphs and other graph manipulation tasks. Though offered libraries were originally designed for Feynman graphs,
they might be useful for more general graph problems.

GraphState and Graphine installation guide. To install use CLI interface (additionally Cygwin for Windows systems)

1. Download packages from "Download" link at https://code.google.com/p/rg-graph/
2. Extract packages

$ tar xvfz Graphine-1.0.5.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz GraphState-1.0.5.tar.gz

3. Sequentially install packages

$ cd GraphState-1.0.5
# python setup.py install

$ cd ..
$ cd Graphine-1.0.5
# python setup.py install
